**"I quit..."** This is the last thing anybody wants to hear from their employees. In a sense, it’s the employees who make the company. It’s the employees who do the work. It’s the employees who shape the company’s culture.

High rate of employee turnover can lead the company to huge monetary losses. Recognizing and understanding what factors are associated with employee turnover will allow companies and individuals to limit this from happening and may even increase employee productivity and growth.

These predictive insights give managers the opportunity to take corrective steps to build and preserve their successful business.

## The Problem:
One of the most common problems at work is employee turnover which can be a nightmare for the companies. Replacing a worker earning about **50,000 dollars** cost the company about **10,000 dollars** or **20%** of that worker’s yearly income according to the _Center of American Progress_.

### Costs include:

* Cost of off-boarding
* Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring)
* Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time)
* Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the productivity of an existing person)
